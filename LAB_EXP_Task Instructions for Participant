Task Instructions for Participants to the lab experiment
************************************************************************************

Dear Participant,

You will now watch one or more short videos providing essential information. After watching the videos, you will have 40 minutes to complete your tasks, which will involve writing.

Your attentiveness will be assessed through ad hoc questions based on the instructions provided in the videos.

In this project, you will take on the role of the CEO of Yellow Apron, a food delivery startup founded in 2023 and based in California, U.S.A.
Yellow Apron specializes in delivering pre-portioned ingredients and chef-inspired recipes, making meal preparation easy and enjoyable. The company also offers pre-cooked meals for added convenience, with a menu that includes vegetarian, wellness-focused, and family-friendly options.
All ingredients are sustainably sourced, and customers can subscribe to flexible plans tailored to their dietary preferences.

Your task is to analyze historical data about Yellow Apron from 2024, presented on a custom platform that you will be allowed to access. Using basic data analytics skills, you will propose up to 10 innovations (related to business offer(s) and/or technology) that Yellow Apron could implement to maximize customer acquisition, revenue, and consumer engagement.

Your proposals might reference specific trends in the data (e.g., increases, decreases, or spikes) and may incorporate your own insights or experience, which you should clearly describe.

Incentive: The two best innovations, as judged by the project team, will each win a $100 prize.
